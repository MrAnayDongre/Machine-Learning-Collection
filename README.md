This GitHub repository contains various machine learning projects implemented in both PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks, along with the respective datasets used in these projects. The projects included in this repository cover a wide range of topics such as the basics of machine learning, advanced topics like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), EfficientNet, Image Segmentation, Object Detection, and more. Each project has a detailed README file that outlines the problem statement, methodology, results, and code implementation. The code is structured and easy to follow, making it accessible to both beginners and experts. Overall, this repository serves as an excellent resource for anyone interested in learning and applying machine learning algorithms in practical settings.


This repository is contribution friendly, so if you feel you want to add something then I'd happily merge a PR ðŸ˜ƒ.

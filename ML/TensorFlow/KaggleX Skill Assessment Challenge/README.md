## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model for car prices using a dataset with various features such as brand, model, year, engine specifications, mileage, and more. The solution involves data cleaning, feature engineering, preprocessing, model building with TensorFlow, and generating predictions for the test set.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of two main files:
- `train.csv`: Contains the training data with car features and prices.
- `test.csv`: Contains the test data with car features for which we need to predict prices.

### Columns in the dataset:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each car
- `brand`: Brand of the car
- `model`: Model of the car
- `model_year`: Year the car model was manufactured
- `milage`: Mileage of the car
- `fuel_type`: Type of fuel used by the car
- `transmission`: Type of transmission
- `ext_col`: Exterior color of the car
- `int_col`: Interior color of the car
- `engine`: Engine specifications
- `accident`: Accident history
- `clean_title`: Indicates if the car has a clean title
- `price`: Price of the car (only in the training set)

## Feature Engineering

Several new features were created to enhance the model's performance:
- `age`: Age of the car based on the model year.
- `brand_model`: Combined feature of brand and model.
- `engine_power`: Extracted engine power in HP from the `engine` column.
- `engine_size`: Extracted engine size in liters from the `engine` column.
- `is_luxury`: Binary feature indicating if the car is from a luxury brand.
- `accident_binary`: Binary feature indicating if the car has any reported accidents.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing pipeline includes:
- Imputation for missing values.
- Scaling of numerical features.
- One-hot encoding of categorical features.
- Log transformation of the target variable (price) to stabilize variance.

## Model Architecture

The model is a neural network implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture includes:

- Input layer matching the number of processed features.
- Four hidden layers with decreasing number of units (512, 256, 128, 64), each followed by batch normalization and dropout for regularization.
- Output layer with a single unit for the predicted price in log scale.

The model uses L2 regularization and the Adam optimizer. Callbacks for early stopping and learning rate reduction on plateau are also included.

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the processed training data. The validation set is used to monitor performance and apply early stopping. The evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the log-transformed prices.

## Submission

The predictions for the test set are generated by applying the trained model to the processed test data. The predicted log prices are converted back to the original scale using the exponential function. A submission file is then created with the predicted prices.
